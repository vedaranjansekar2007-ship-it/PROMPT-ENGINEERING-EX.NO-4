Procedure:

1. Comparative Analysis Prompt <br> 
Prompt:Compare AC and DC current in a table. <br>
   Ans: <br>
   
   | Feature           | AC (Alternating Current)         | DC (Direct Current)                  |
   | ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
   | Direction of flow | Changes direction periodically   | Flows in one direction only          |
   | Magnitude         | Varies with time                 | Constant                             |
   | Source            | Power stations, generators       | Batteries, solar cells               |
   | Transmission      | Efficient for long distances     | Less efficient for long distances    |
   | Frequency         | Has frequency (e.g., 50 Hz)      | Zero frequency                       |
   | Common uses       | Home and industrial power supply | Electronic devices, charging systems |

2. Experiential Perspective Prompt <br> 
Prompt: As a student, describe your experience with online learning. <br>
   Ans: As a student, my experience with online learning has been flexible and convenient, allowing me to attend classes from home and learn at my own pace. It helped me access recorded               lessons and digital resources easily. However, staying focused for long hours and limited interaction with teachers and classmates were challenging. Overall, it was useful but works           best when combined with regular classroom learning. <br> 
Evaluation: <br> 
Quality: High <br>
Accuracy: Context-based <br>
Depth: Moderate, experiential <br> 

3. Everyday Functioning Prompt <br>
Prompt: Explain how a refrigerator works in simple terms.<br>
   Ans: A refrigerator works by removing heat from inside and releasing it outside. A cooling fluid absorbs heat from the food compartment, making it cold. This heat is then released at the           back of the refrigerator. The process keeps the food fresh and cool. <br> 
Evaluation: <br>
Quality: High <br>
Accuracy: High <br>
Depth: Basic, easy to understand <br> 

4. Universal Prompt Structure <br>
Prompt: Explain photosynthesis, its process, and importance briefly. <br>
   Ans: Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants make their own food using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. Chlorophyll in the leaves absorbs sunlight to produce glucose and            oxygen. This process is important because it provides food for plants and releases oxygen needed for life on Earth. <br>

Accuracy: High <br>
Depth: Balanced <br>

5. Prompt Refinement <br>
Broad Prompt: Explain climate change. <br>
         Ans: Climate change refers to long-term changes in Earth’s temperature and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These                    activities increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which trap heat and lead to global warming. Climate change results in rising temperatures, melting ice, sea-level rise,                 and more extreme weather events. <br> <br>
Refined Prompt: Explain climate change in 4–5 sentences focusing on causes and effects. <br>
           Ans: Climate change is the long-term change in Earth’s temperature and weather patterns. It is mainly caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and                    industrial pollution, which increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and lead to global warming. The effects include rising temperatures, melting                     glaciers, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events like floods and droughts. Climate change also affects agriculture, ecosystems, and human health. <br> 
Evaluation: <br>
Refined prompt gives clearer and more focused output. <br> 

6. Prompt Size Limitation <br>
Prompt: Define artificial intelligence in one sentence. <br>
   Ans: Artificial intelligence is the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making. <br> 
Evaluation: <br>
Quality: High <br>
Accuracy: High <br>
Depth: Limited due to size constraint <br>
